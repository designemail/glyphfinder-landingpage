# Glyphfinder

Glyphfinder is the missing character search for designers, developers and writers.

## Features

* Finds Everything: Search for words, categories, look-alikes or colors – you can’t do it wrong.
* Looks like …: It’s easier to visually remember a glyph, so we made it easy to search for look-alikes.
* The Best Emoji Search: We have manually added and tagged every single emoji.
* Learn More: In case you want to go mouseless, learn the keyboard shortcuts for all your favorite glyphs right away.
* 30.000+ Glyphs: With our enormous database you have more than 30.000 characters right at your fingertips.
* Quick Access: Your most frequently used glyphs will be pinned to the top.
* Offline Support: No Wi-fi – no problem.
* Really Fast Search: Search should feel instant, so that‘s what we made it.
* Dark Mode by Default: No one wants a flash of bright light in their face when looking up a few glyphs.
* macOS & Windows: Glyphfinder will work on your favorite operating system (as long as it’s not Linux).

## FAQ

### Do you offer a trial?
We didn’t implement a trial, but feel free to purchase the app. If you’re not happy send a short message. We’ll refund your order, no questions asked.

### Does Glyphfinder have all unicode characters in the world?
To be honest, not at all. Currently, there are 130.000+ characters in unicode. We focus on Western glyphs and emojis (all!) and filter out everything that can’t be rendered on your system.

In the end we have 30.000+ characters, all of them manually tagged. That should be enough for your daily work. Let us know if you think anything important is missing!

### Is Glyphfinder available for Linux?
Not for now. But give us a shout and we’ll consider it.

### Something’s wrong. How do I get in touch?
Sorry to hear something is off. [Send us an email](mailto:support@glyphfinder.com), we’ll be happy to help!

### I have a great idea, whom should I send an email?
Good news for you: We have a [public feedback board](https://feedback.glyphfinder.com).

Use this board to promote your ideas not only to us, but to other users as well. We will consider and reply to every suggestion.

### Do you collect my personal data?
The app needs the internet connection to check your license once, everything else is working offline. We don’t track anything at all, except the number of sales and the number of pageviews. To learn more, check out our privacy policy.
