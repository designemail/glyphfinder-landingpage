# Glyphfinder Landingpage

[![Sponsor](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Sponsor&message=%E2%9D%A4&logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/sponsors/ueberdosis)

This landingpage is used to promote [Glyphfinder](https://github.com/ueberdosis/glyphfinder-landing) (which is open source, too). We used Gridsome (based on Vue.js) as a static site generator. The master branch is deployed to https://www.glyphfinder.com on push.
